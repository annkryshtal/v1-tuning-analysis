## üß¨ Project Overview

This repository contains simulation and modeling code developed for my MSc Neuroscience thesis. The goal is to understand how populations of neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) encode orientation and contrast information through reverse correlation and tuning curve analysis.

Using synthetic spiking data (homogeneous and inhomogeneous Poisson processes), I reconstruct reverse correlation kernels and apply model fitting (von Mises and wrapped Gaussian) to explore tuning properties and contrast invariance.

## üõ† Dependencies

This code uses:

- `numpy`, `pandas`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- `lmfit` for multi-parameter fitting
- `statsmodels`, `adjustText`, `mycolorpy`


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes on Lab-Specific Code
Some parts of functions_for_fitting_updated.py use internal modules from a DataJoint-based codebase (`djd.*`, e.g., `djd.revcorr`, `djd.unit`, `djd.tuning`, etc.).
These are not included in this repository. They are used only for experiment-specific data access. All model functions, tuning curve fitting, and simulation logic are self-contained and reusable.

To run the code independently:
Comment out or replace `djd.*` imports.

## üìä Sample Output
This figure demonstrates orientation tuning curve fitting using a von Mises function, generated with functions from `functions_for_fitting_updated.py`.
